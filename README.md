# Finance Database

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

Finance Database is a basic frontend project for my currency-api. Project still in demo. Currently developing by me.
Website has dynamic currency tables, and cards. Also active authentication and mail systems.

Visual and ease of use improvements will be added soon.

## Requirements

For development, you will need my currency-api, Node.js, Angular CLI and a node global package, installed in your environement.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v12.16.3

    $ npm --version
    6.14.4

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

### currency-api
- ### Installation

    Open bash shell and

    $ git clone https://github.com/Muratcol/currency-api
    $ cd currency-api
    $ npm install

    Later go to [currency-api](https://github.com/Muratcol/currency-api/blob/master/README.md) and create your own configration settings. 

    Now we are ready for Angular.


### Angular CLI
- ### Angular installation on Windows

	You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

    Install the Angular CLI globally.

    `npm install -g @angular/cli`

	If you have problems, just go to [official Angular website](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) for more informations.
